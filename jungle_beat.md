## Before You Begin

We're going to do some silly things with sound and linked lists. Let's make a drum machine that's backed by a linked list.

### Making Sound

Go into your Terminal and try this:

```
$ say -r 500 -v Boing "ding, dah, oom, oom, ding, oom, oom, oom, ding, dah, oom, oom, ding, dah, oom, oom, ding, dah, oom, oom "
```

Yeah. That's what we're looking for. Now try it from Ruby:

```
$ pry
> `say -r 500 -v Boing "ding, dah, oom, oom"`
```

Note that the backticks allow you to run terminal commands from within Ruby.

### Linked Lists

Linked Lists are one of the most fundamental Computer Science data structures. A Linked List models a collection of data as a series of "nodes" which link to one another in a chain.

In a singly-linked list (the type we will be building) you have a __head__, which is a node representing the "start" of the list, and subsequent nodes which make up the remainder of the list.

The __list__ itself can hold a reference to one thing -- the head node.

Each node can hold a single element of data and a link to the next node in the list.

The last node of the list is often called its __tail__.

Using sweet ASCII art, it might look like this:

```
List -- (head) --> ["hello" | -]-- (link) --> ["world" | -]-- (link) --> ["!" | ]
```
The three nodes here hold the data "hello", "world", and "!". The first two nodes have links which point to other nodes. The last node, holding the data "!", has no reference in the link spot. This signifies that it is the end of the list.

## Learning Goals / Areas of Focus

* Practice breaking a program into logical components
* Distinguishing between classes and instances of those classes
* Understanding how linked lists work to store and find data
* Testing components in isolation and in combination

## Base Expectations

Then we'll exercise the functionality from a Pry session:

```ruby
require "./lib/jungle_beat"
> jb = JungleBeat.new("deep dep dep deep")
> jb.play
=> 4 # also plays the sounds
> jb.append("deep bop bop deep")
=> 4
> jb.all
=> "deep dep dep deep deep bop bop deep"
> jb.prepend("tee tee tee tee")
=> 4 # number of beats inserted
> jb.all
=> "tee tee tee tee deep dep dep deep deep bop bop deep"
> jb.include?("dep")
=> true
> jb.pop(4)
=> "deep bop bop deep"
> jb.all
=> "tee tee tee tee deep dep dep deep"
> jb.count
=> 8
> jb.insert(4, "boop bop bop boop")
=> "tee tee tee tee boop bop bop boop deep dep dep deep"
> jb.find(8, 2)
=> "deep dep"
```

### Internal Structure

You must use a Linked List to store your beats. Each node should contain only a single "word"/beat. You'll want to implement at least each of the following features for your list:

* `append` an element to the end of the list
* `prepend` an element at the beginning of the list
* `insert` one or more elements at an arbitrary position in the list
* `includes?` gives back `true` or `false` whether the supplied value is in the list
* `pop` one or more elements from the end of the list
* `count` the number of elements in the list
* `find` one or more elements based on arbitrary positions in the list. The first parameter indicates the first position to return and the second parameter specifies how many elements to return.
* `all` return all elements in the linked list in order

## Extensions

### 1. Validating Beats

There are a lot of words which aren't going to work for beats. Like `Mississippi`.

Add validation to your program such that the input beats must be members of your
defined list. Insertion of a beat not in the list is rejected. Like this:

```ruby
> jb = JungleBeat.new("deep")
> jb.append("Mississippi")
=> 0
> jb.all
=> "deep"
> jb.prepend("tee tee tee Mississippi")
=> 3 # number of beats successfully inserted
> jb.all
=> "tee tee tee deep"
```

Here's a starter list of valid beats, but add more if you like:

```
tee dee deep bop boop la na
```

### 2. Speed & Voice

Let's make it so the user can control the voice and speed of playback. Originally
we showed you to use `say -r 500 -v Boing` where `r` is the rate and `v` is the
voice. Let's setup a usage like this:

```ruby
> jb = JungleBeat.new("deep dop dop deep")
> jb.play
=> 4 # plays the four sounds normal speed with Boing voice
> jb.rate = 100
=> 100
> jb.play
=> 4 # plays the four sounds slower with Boing voice
> jb.voice = "Alice"
=> "Alice"
> jb.play
=> 4 # plays the four sounds slower with Alice voice
> jb.reset_rate
=> 500
> jb.reset_voice
=> "Boing"
> jb.play
=> 4 # plays the four sounds normal speed with Boing voice
```

## Tips

* A linked list it not an array. While it may perform many of the same functions as an array, its structure is conceptually very different.
* There are only 3 types of "state" that need to be tracked for a linked list -- the head of the list, the data of each node, and the "next node" of each node.
* In object-oriented programming, "state" is generally modeled with instance variables
* There are two main ways to implement Linked Lists: __iteration__ and __recursion__. Iterative solutions use looping structures (`while`, `for`) to walk through the nodes in the list. Recursive solutions use methods which call themselves to walk through nodes. It would be ideal to solve it each way.
* Most of your methods will be defined on the `List` itself, but you will need to manipulate one or more `Node`s to implement them.
* __TDD__ will be your friend in implementing the list. Remember to start small, work iteratively, and test all of your methods.
* An __empty__ list has `nil` as its head
* The __tail__ of a list is the node that has `nil` as its next node

## Constraints

* Make sure that your code is well tested for both *expected cases* and *edge cases*. Try popping more elements than there are in the list. Try seeing if an empty list includes anything. Try inserting elements at a position beyond the length of the list. That kind of thing.
* Avoid using other ruby collections (Arrays, Hashes, etc) for the storage of your beats. That's where you're supposed to use the linked list. But having Arrays elsewhere in your code, or using methods that return arrays (like `.split`) are totally ok.
