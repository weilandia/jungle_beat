JungleBeat is the second project of Module 1

_____
Design:

1. What I want and why:
  -Create a "JungleBeat" that is made of individual beats ("Nodes")
    -"JungleBeat" should behave like a Linked List
    -"JungleBeat" should accept a String of beats and     convert them into individual nodes
    -"JungleBeat" should be able to change based on new nodes being added or nodes being removed

  -The "JungleBeat" will be a Linked List
    -We should be able to (append) the Linked List by putting new beats (Nodes) at the end of the list
    -We should be able to print all beats to the screen (all)
    -We should be able to (prepend) the Linked List by putting new beats at the beginning of the list
    -We should be able to identify if particular beats are part of our Linked List (include?)
    -We should be able to remove (pop(n)) a specified number of beats off the end of our Linked List
    -We should be able to count all the beats in our Linked List
    -We should be able to insert (insert(location, string)) a String of beats into our Linked List at a specified location
    -We should be able to find (find(location, number of beats)) what beat is at a specific location in our Linked List.  We should also be able to specify how many beats to find, starting with the given location.

    -The Linked List will be made up of Nodes.
    -Nodes should be made up of a piece of data and a next_node pointer.
