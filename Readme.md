JungleBeat
=======

###Explanation

JungleBeat is project intended to explore linked lists as a data structure in Ruby. The core of the project is a collection of methods that allow for the manipulation of a singly linked list, without the use of Ruby's Array class.  To make the project a little more exciting, the linked list is used in the JungleBeat class to power a drum machine.
